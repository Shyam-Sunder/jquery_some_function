#Explain the animate function.

-The animate function is used to apply the custom animation effect to elements.

-Syntax:

$(selector).animate({params}, [duration], [easing], [callback])

“param” defines the CSS properties on which you want to apply the animation.
“duration” specify how long the animation will run. It can be one of following values : “slow”, “fast”, “normal” or milliseconds
“easing” is the string which specify the function for the transition.
“callback” is the function which we want to run once the animation effect is complete.

#What is the use of param() method.

The param() method is used to represent an array or an object in serialize manner.
While making an ajax request we can use these serialize values in the query strings of URL.
Syntax: $.param(object | array, boolValue)
“object | array” specifies an array or an object to be serialized.
“boolValue” specifies whether to use the traditional style of param serialization or not.
For example:

personObj=new Object();
empObject.name="Arpit";
empObject.age="24";
empObject.dept=”IT”;
$("#clickme").click(function(){
$("span").text($.param(empObject));
});
It will set the text of span to “name=Arpit&age=24&dep=IT”

#What is jQuery.holdReady() function?

-By using jQuery.holdReady() function we can hold or release the execution of jQuery’s ready event.
-This method should be call before we run ready event.
-To delay the ready event, we have to call

jQuery.holdReady(true);

-When we want to release the ready event then we have to call
jQuery.holdReady(false);
-This function is helpful when we want to load any jQuery plugins before the execution of ready event.

For example

$.holdReady(true);
$.getScript("xyzplugin.js", function() {
$.holdReady(false);
});

#Explain .empty() vs .remove() vs .detach().

-.empty() method is used to remove all the child elements from matched elements.
-.remove() method is used to remove all the matched element. This method will remove all the jQuery data associated with the matched element.
-.detach() method is same as .remove() method except that the .detach() method doesn’t remove jQuery data associated with the matched elements.
-.remove() is faster than .empty() or .detach() method.

$(selector).empty();
$(selector).remove();
$(selector).detach();
